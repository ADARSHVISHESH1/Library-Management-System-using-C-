A Library Management System in C++ is a software application designed to manage the operations of a library, such as book borrowing, returning, catalog management, and user registration. Here's a detailed description:

Features:
User Authentication:

The system includes user authentication where library staff or members can log in. Staff members have administrative privileges, whereas members have limited access to borrowing and returning books.

Book Management:
Add Book: Staff can add new books to the library's catalog by providing details such as the book title, author, ISBN, publication year, and genre.
View Books: Both staff and members can view the list of books in the library.
Search Book: Users can search for books using different parameters like title, author, or genre.
Remove Book: Staff can remove books that are no longer available.

Member Management:
Add Member: Staff can register new members by collecting necessary details such as name, ID, and contact information.
Remove Member: Staff can remove members from the system, e.g., when a membership expires or when a user is inactive.
View Members: Staff can view the list of members.

Borrowing and Returning Books:
Borrow Book: Registered members can borrow books. The system checks the availability of the book, assigns the book to the member, and records the borrowing date.
Return Book: Members can return borrowed books. The system will update the book status and compute any late fees if applicable.

Transaction Management:
The system keeps track of all transactions, such as book borrowing, returning, and any overdue penalties.
Issue Penalties: If a book is returned after the due date, the system calculates the overdue penalty based on a predefined rate.

File Management System:
The system can read and write data from files (e.g., member data, book data) for persistence. Each time the system starts, it loads data from files, and any changes are saved back.
Report Generation:

The system can generate reports such as a list of borrowed books, available books, member borrowing history, and more.
